    "    Training: The phase where you the model is trained or learned. You show the model a number of examples of labeled data, and allow the model to learn the relationship between the features and the label.

    "\n",
    "* The convention in machine learning is to represent the linear model as $y' = w_1 x_1 + b$ instead of the more traditional $y = mx + b$. We could easily generalize this regression from one feature to multiple features and the prediction would be given by $y' = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 + b$, where all the $w_i$'s are weights and all the $x_i$'s are features. The process of fitting the model is called training and the process of using the trained model to make a prediction is called inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A commonly used loss function is the mean squared error (MSE), but this is neither the only loss function nor the best or most practical loss function for all cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reducing Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the popular ways to find the minimum in the loss function is to use Gradient Descent. We calculate a gradient at each point and move in the direction of decreasing gradient. The step size that we use as we advance in the direction of decreasing gradient is called the learning rate. This has to be chosen carefully: in multi-dimensional problems, too large a learning rate can cause the code to become unstable. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We can also get trapped in local minima if the space is *not-convex*. There is a whole sprawling field of non-convex optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two important flavors of gradient descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Stochastic Gradient Descent:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In theory, while using gradient descent, we need to calculate the gradient of the loss function considering all examples. However in practice, this is found to be excessive and computationally expensive. We therefore select only one example at random and calculate the gradient of the loss function considering only that one example. This is called stochastic gradient descent. Although this might require more steps to reach the optimum, overall there is usually less computation when dealing with very large data sets. Gradient calculations can be very expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Mathematically, we want to calculate \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\begin{align}\n",
    "    w_{n+1} = w_n -\\eta Q(w)\n",
    "    \\end{align}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $\\eta$ is the learning rate and $Q(w) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i Q_i(w)$ is the $L_2$ loss for the $i$-th example. What we do instead, in stochastic gradient descent is to first randomnly pick a particular example $k$ and calculate the loss function $Q_k(w)$ and then update $w$ using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\begin{align}\n",
    "    w_{n+1} = w_n -\\eta Q_k(w)\n",
    "    \\end{align}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    and perform this iteratively until the minimum criterion is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "    When there are multiple parameters to optimize, the gradient is of course a vector, and so is $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, \\ldots)$ and we proceed in the direction of steepest gradient in steps $\\eta$ large. \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is very similar to stochastic gradient descent except that instead of taking only one data point, we take batches of 10 or 100 of them.  Especially with datasets that contain duplicates, enormous datasets do not contain any further information than very large datasets. Mini-batch gradient descent exploits this fact and works very well in practice. Typical values of batch-size range between 10 and 1000. Stochastic gradient descent is an extreme example of mini-batch gradient descent with batch size 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The algorithm to train the model in this case is iterative: we start with some intial guesses for the parameters, compute the loss function for those values, update the values of the parameters through some scheme (with the goal of moving in the direction of lower loss), calculate the loss for the updated values of the parameters, and proceed iteratively until we achieve convergence. Convergence is usually assumed when the loss becomes below some threshold value, or if the loss function starts changing extremely slowly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## First steps with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "* TensnsorFlow is a computational framework that allows you to build machine learning models. We can use both lower level APIs by defining models based on a series of mathematical operations or we could use predefined higher level APIs such as `tf.estimator`. These architectures can be linear regressors or neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* TensorFlow consists of the following two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0. A graph protocol buffer\n",
    "    0. A runtime that executes the distributed graph\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **graph protocol buffer** or protobuf takes data structures written in a text file and then generates classes in Python (or other language) that allows you to load, save and interact with the data in a user friendly way. In this sense the protobuf and the runtime are akin to Python code and a Python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Because TensorFlow is built using APIs of various levels of abstraction, we have a choice of level. In general, I should chose the layer that offers the highest level of abstraction. Of course, the highest layers are also less flexible, so for some special modeling cases if I need more flexibility, I can just drop one run lower in the level of API. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `tf.estimator` API\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tf.estimator` API is one of the highest level APIs that has a lot of prepackaged tools of use. Below we show some code to exemplify its use. In the example below, we are going to estimate the median housing pricebased on just one input feature. The data is from the 1990 California housing census data.
