Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a soft matter physicist and surface scientist. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the summer 2014. I have since been in ExxonMobil's Corporate Strategic Research lab in Clinton, NJ.

For the last two years of my professional life, I have embarked on a serious self-study program to apply machine learning/artificial intelligence to learn how to advance the process of materials design and discovery. I was motivated by the challenge of advanced materials discovery using the traditional route of molecule conception, lab synthesis, verification of synthesized molecule through experimental techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (did we actually make the molecule we set out to make?), property prediction, and iteration of this cycle. This traditional is an extremely time-consuming and expensive approach. The field of AI has shown great promise in speeding up this advanced materials discovery life cycle, which was what drew me in. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with the field. The mathematical elegance of back-propagation, the deeper connection between neural networks and function approximation, the modular and intuitive python libraries, the efficiency of the structure of the algorithms, and in particular, the recursive beauty of reinforcement learning, all fascinated me. I'm eager to dive deeper and join this field full time. Please look through the links above to see relevant coursework I have completed, projects implemented (all of them from scratch), the nature of my Ph.D Research, my Resume, and a list of my peer-reviewed publications.

<!-- I write about Fluid Mechanics, Mathematics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and other topics of general scietific interest.
