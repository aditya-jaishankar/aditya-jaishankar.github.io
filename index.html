<h1>Personal Webpage of Aditya Jaishankar</h1>

Welcome.

I am a soft matter physicist and surface scientist, with experimental and mathematical modeling experience. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the summer 2014. I have since been in ExxonMobil's Corporate Strategic Research lab in Clinton, NJ. My full CV is available through the sidebar link.

For the last two years of my professional life, I have embarked on a serious self-study program to apply machine learning/artificial intelligence to learn how to advance the process of materials design and discovery. I was motivated by the challenge of advanced materials discovery; the future demands stronger materials, cleaner plastics, more efficient batteries, and safer drugs. These grand problems are all getting increasingly complex due the stringent performance demands required. The traditional route of molecule conception, lab synthesis, verification of synthesis (did we actually make the molecule we set out to make?), property measurements, and iteration of this cycle is fast becoming inadequate for the future. This traditional approach is too time-consuming and expensive. The field of AI has shown great promise in speeding up this advanced materials discovery life cycle, starting from neural networks for probabilistic predictions to reinforcement learning algorithms for optimal reaction and processing conditions. Somewhere along the way in my self-study journey, I fell in love with the field. The mathematical elegance of back-propagation, the deeper connection between neural networks and function approximation, the modular and intuitive python libraries, the efficiency of the structure of the algorithms, and in particular, the recursive beauty of reinforcement learning, all fascinated me. I'm eager to dive deeper and join this field. Please look through the links above to see relevant coursework I have completed, projects implemented (all of them from scratch), the nature of my Ph.D Research, my Resume, and a list of my peer-reviewed publications.

<!-- I write about Fluid Mechanics, Mathematics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and other topics of general scietific interest.
