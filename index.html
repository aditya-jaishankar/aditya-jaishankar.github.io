    <i>How can it be that writing down a few simple and elegant formulae, like short poems governed by strict rules such as those of the sonnet or the waka, can predict universal regularities of Nature? Perhaps we see equations as simple because they are easily expressed in terms of mathematical notation already invented at an earlier stage of development of the science, and thus what appears to us as elegance of description really reflects the interconnectedness of Nature's laws at different levels.</i>

<h2>Biography</h2>
    I am a soft matter physicist and surface scientist with experience in theoretical, computational (numerical) and experimental work. I am currently at <a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Research-and-innovation/Research-and-development-highlights">ExxonMobil Corporate Strategic Research Lab</a> working on mathematical models to enable the efficient capture CO<sub>2</sub> directly from air. I also work on developing molecularly thick self-assembled surfaces that provide ultra-low friction for more fuel efficient engines.
    <br>
    <br>
    I received a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in July 2014. I worked with <a href="https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/GARETH@MIT.EDU">Professor Gareth McKinley</a> in the <a href="https://nnf.mit.edu/">Non-Newtonian Fluid Dynamics Group</a>. My thesis, titled <b>The Linear and Nonlinear Rheology of Multiscale Complex Fluids</b> developed theoretical models for describing the behavior of soft materials and <i>complex fluids</i> whose building blocks are arranged in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal patterns.</a> You can read more about my research <a href="/research/">here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Earlier, I graduated from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Madras with a Bachelor of Technology degree.

<h2>Current Research Interest</h2>
    I am currently interested in applying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery. A sampling of my projects and coursework in ML and AI is available through the links above. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I am motivated by the challenge of advanced materials design and discovery; the future demands stronger, lighter, inexpensive materials with smaller CO<sub>2</sub> footprints, sustainable and recyclable plastics, efficient and safe batteries with high energy densities, drugs with fewer side effects, early cancer detection techniques, and so much more. The complexity and scale of these grand problems make traditional methods of scientific discovery inadequate. For example, in materials discovery, the traditional pathway of molecule conception, lab synthesis, verification of synthesis, property measurements, and iteration of this cycle, is too time-consuming and expensive. The field of AI has shown great promise in speeding up this advanced materials discovery life cycle, ranging from <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00601">molecular graph based neural networks for probabilistic predictions of material properties</a>, to <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00492">reinforcement learning algorithms for optimal reaction and processing conditions</a>. Using deep neural networks as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07200">function approximators for systems of partial differential equations</a> has also shown promise in solving intractable theoretical and numerical problems. I am fascinated by this emerging area of research and the revolution it is causing in the traditional approach of scientific discovery.
