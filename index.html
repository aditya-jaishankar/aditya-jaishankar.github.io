Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a soft matter physicist and surface scientist. 
<br>
<br>
For the last two years of my professional life, I embarked on a serious self-study program to apply machine learning/artificial intelligence to learn how to advance the process of materials design and discovery. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with the field and I'm eager to dive deeper apply join this field full time. Please click through the links above to see relevant coursework I have completed, projects implements (all of them from scratch), my Ph.D Research, my Resume, and a list of my peer-reviewed publications.

<!-- I write about Fluid Mechanics, Mathematics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and other topics of general scietific interest.
